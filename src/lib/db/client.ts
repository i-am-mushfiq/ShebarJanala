/**
 * Database access point.
 *
 * The ONLY file that knows which SQL engine is in use. Repositories consume
 * `db` and Drizzle's dialect-agnostic query builder, so migrating to
 * PostgreSQL + pgvector (PRD §37) touches this file, drizzle.config.ts, and
 * the column helpers in schema.ts — no service or route changes.
 *
 * Two `@libsql/client` builds are used, picked by URL scheme, because
 * Cloudflare Workers cannot run the native bindings the default build needs
 * for a local `file:` database:
 *   - `file:` (local dev, tests)   → the default build (native bindings, no
 *     edge runtime support, but the only one that can open a local file).
 *   - `libsql:`/`https:` (Turso)   → `@libsql/client/web`, a pure
 *     fetch/WebSocket implementation with no native bindings, so it survives
 *     the Cloudflare Workers bundle; this is what production always uses.
 *
 * The `file:` branch is loaded through `createRequire` with a specifier
 * built at runtime (not a string literal), so it is opaque to both Next's
 * own build and the bundler that packages the app for Cloudflare Workers —
 * a literal `require(...)` or `import(...)`, even through `createRequire`,
 * gets resolved and inlined by both, and `@libsql/client`'s native bindings
 * and hrana/websocket transport cannot be resolved for the workerd target,
 * even though this branch is never reached there (`DATABASE_URL` is never
 * `file:` in production).
